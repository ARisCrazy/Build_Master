        <b><h3>Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to build a PC:</h3></b>
        <br><p><b>Step 1:</b> Plan and Choose Components
        <br><br>- CPU (Central Processing Unit): Choose a processor that suits your needs and fits your selected motherboard's socket type. <i>IF YOU ARE NOT USING A DEDICATED GRAPHICS CARD PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOUR CPU HAS INTEGRATED GRAPHICS.</i>
        <img src="cpu1.jpg" class="part" alt="cpu"><br><br>
        - Motherboard: Ensure it is compatible with your CPU and has the necessary features (e.g., RAM slots, expansion slots, connectivity options).
        <br><br>
        - RAM (Random Access Memory): Select the appropriate type and capacity of RAM for your motherboard and tasks. Recommend: 8GB minimum for smoother work.
        <br><br>
        - Storage: Decide between SSD (Solid State Drive) or HDD (Hard Disk Drive) and choose the capacity based on your storage needs. You can use both, SSD for Operating System(Windows) or important softwares and HDD for storage. <br>
        RECOMMENDED: 250GB SSD and 1/2TB HDD based on your need.
        <br><br>
        - Graphics Card (GPU): If you're building a gaming PC or need powerful graphics processing, choose a dedicated GPU.
        <br><br>
        - Power Supply Unit (PSU): Ensure it has enough wattage to power all your components and is of good quality.
        <br><br>
        - PC Case: Select a case that can accommodate your chosen components and has proper airflow and cable management options.
        <br><br>
        - CPU Cooler: If your CPU doesn't come with a stock cooler, choose an aftermarket cooler.
        <br><br>
        - Keyboard and Mouse: You can buy any Keyboard and Mouse of your preference.
        <br><br>
        - Monitor: Any Monitor of your preference.
        <br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b> Set Up Your Workspace
        <br><br>Find a clean, well-lit, and static-free workspace to build your PC. Best to use a wooden table. Remove any static-inducing objects like woolen carpets or plastic surfaces.
        <br><br><b>Step 3:</b> Prepare the PC Case
        <br><br>Remove both side panels from the PC case and keep the screws in a safe place. Depending on your case, there might be pre-installed standoffs. If not, install the standoffs in the correct positions corresponding to your motherboard's screw holes. Refer to your motherboard's manual for the proper layout.
        <br><br><b>Step 4:</b> Install the CPU
        <br><br>Carefully remove the CPU from its packaging, handling it by the edges to avoid damaging the delicate pins. Open the CPU socket on the motherboard by lifting the retention arm. Align the notches or arrows on the CPU with those on the socket and gently place the CPU in position. Do not force it; it should fall into place naturally. Lower the retention arm to secure the CPU in place.
        <br><br><b>Step 5:</b> Apply Thermal Paste and Install CPU Cooler
        <br><br>If your CPU cooler doesn't have pre-applied thermal paste (its dried and white), apply a small pea-sized amount to the center of the CPU. Avoid using too much paste, as it can lead to overheating. Next, install the CPU cooler according to the manufacturer's instructions. This may involve attaching brackets or using a specific mounting mechanism. Ensure the cooler is firmly in place and making good contact with the CPU.
        <br><br><b>Step 6:</b> Install RAM
        <br><br>Check your motherboard's manual to identify the correct RAM slots for your configuration. Press down the retention clips on the slots to open them. Align the notch on the RAM stick with the slot's key, and gently insert the RAM module into the slot until the clips automatically close and lock it in place. Repeat this process for additional RAM modules if you have them.
        <br><br><b>Step 7:</b> Install Storage and Graphics Card
        <br><br>Mount your SSD or HDD in the designated drive bays in the case using screws provided. For an M.2 SSD, it usually slots directly into the motherboard. If you have a dedicated graphics card, align it with the appropriate PCI-E slot on the motherboard and gently press it down until it clicks into place.
        <br><br><b>Step 8:</b> Connect Cables to Components
        <br><br>Attach the necessary power cables from the PSU to the motherboard, CPU, GPU, storage drives, and other components. Make sure each connection is secure. Use cable ties to manage the cables and keep them tidy, improving airflow and aesthetics.
        <br><br><b>Step 9:</b> Connect Front Panel Cables
        <br><br>Connect the front panel cables from the PC case to the corresponding headers on the motherboard. These cables include the power button, reset button, USB ports, audio ports, etc. Consult your motherboard's manual to identify the correct pinouts for each connection.
        <br><br><b>Step 10:</b> Double-Check Connections
        <br><br>Before closing the case, double-check all your connections to ensure everything is properly connected and secured. Take extra care with the front panel connectors, as they can be easy to misplace.
        <br><br><b>Step 11:</b> Close the Case and Power On
        <br><br>Once you're confident with the build, carefully put both side panels back onto the case and secure them with the screws. Connect your monitor, keyboard, and mouse. If you have installed a Graphics card ensure you plug in the display cable to your GPU. Plug in the power cable and turn on the PSU. Finally, press the power button on your PC to boot it up.
        <br><br><b>Step 12:</b> Install Operating System and Drivers
        <br><br>If everything is working correctly, your PC will display the BIOS screen or the operating system's installation prompt (ONLY IF YOU HAVE OS ON YOUR BOOTABLE PENDRIVE). Follow the on-screen instructions to install your preferred operating system. After installation, download and install the necessary drivers for your components, including graphics, chipset, and audio drivers.
        <br><br>How to install Windows: Installing windows from a USB
        <br><br><b>Step 13:</b> Final Touches and Testing
        <br><br>Once your OS and drivers are installed, you can customize your PC further, including adjusting BIOS settings, installing software, and personalizing your desktop. Run stability tests and benchmarking software to ensure everything is functioning as expected and performing optimally.
